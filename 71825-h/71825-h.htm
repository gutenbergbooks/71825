<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capo.jpg' style='float:left;width:12%;' alt='O'/>ne</span> summer afternoon
many years
ago a child, called
Peggy Roberts, arrived
at the door
of her aunt’s house
in an open carriage.
Peggy was just eight years old.
She had been in the train since
early in the morning, and
was very tired when the
carriage stopped at the
door of Seafield.
Then she noticed that
everything round her
was new and different from things at home, and she
forgot about feeling tired. The house was exactly
like the tea-caddy that stood on the dining-room side-board
at home, and had been brought from China by
her uncle—that is to say, it was quite square, and
you felt as if you could lift off the top like the lid of
the tea-caddy.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:30%'>
<img src='images/001.jpg' alt='crying' id='iid-0004' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>Right up to the windows there grew such a lovely
rose-tree, covered all over with branches of bright
red roses.</p>

<p>“O Martin, let me get some of the roses!” Peggy
cried, standing still on the steps of the house.</p>

<p>Martin was her aunt’s maid, a stout, cross-looking
woman, who always refused to allow Peggy to do
anything she wanted.</p>

<p>“No, no, Miss Peggy, come in for your tea; the
roses are far too high up,” she said. Peggy looked up
at the beautiful dangling branches, and her mouth
went down at the corners; she thought nothing
would make her happy unless she got one of them.</p>

<p>It must have been because she was so tired that
she began to cry about nothing in this way. The
coachman was more good-natured than Martin, however,
for he stood up on the box of the carriage and
gathered a bunch of the roses. “Here, missie,” he
said, leaning down from his high seat, and handing
them to Peggy.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” Peggy cried, burying her nose in
the lovely red bunch.</p>

<p>But then something horrid happened: a whole
family of great, fat, brown earwigs came hurrying
and dropping out of the roses, in the greatest speed
to get away. Down went the roses on to the steps,
and Peggy cried in earnest now.</p>

<p>There was nothing she hated like earwigs, and
to have a whole nest of them fall out on her frock
was too much for her altogether. And then Martin
was so pleased.</p>

<p>“See there, Miss Peggy; that’s what you get for
wanting to pick flowers!” she said. But she did
brush away the earwigs, and stamped upon the biggest
of them to Peggy’s great disgust. Then they
went into the house, and she had to speak to her
aunt; and, of course, she had nothing to say to her.</p>

<p>Tea was on the table. A different kind of bread
was there from the home-bread Peggy knew. She
went and stood beside the table and looked at it, then
put out her finger and touched it.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch things on the table!” said Aunt
Euphemia.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry!” said Peggy, and wanted to cry again.
But the door opened, and such an exceedingly nice cat
came walking in, just as if the house belonged to it,
that she forgot all about crying.</p>

<p>She ran to the cat, and went down on her knees on
the carpet to stroke him.</p>

<p>“He is called Patrick,” said Aunt Euphemia;
“take care that he does not scratch you.”</p>

<p>But Patrick did not mean to scratch. He rubbed
his big yellow face against Peggy in the most friendly
way, and then walked to the tea-table and jumped up
on a chair and mewed twice, very loudly, exactly as
if he were asking for his tea.</p>

<p>“Patrick is very punctual,” said Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>She poured out a saucer of milk for him, and
put it on the floor. Peggy sat down on the carpet
to watch him take it. His little red tongue was so
rough and funny, she laughed out aloud at seeing
it dart in and out of the milk. Patrick never
paused for a minute till he had licked the saucer so
dry that you would have thought it had been washed.
Then he licked his long, yellow whiskers, and walked
away to the other end of the room, jumped on to
the sofa, and was fast asleep in a minute. Peggy
wanted to waken him, and make him play with
her; but Aunt Euphemia wouldn’t allow her. As
her own tea was brought in at that moment, however,
she became interested in it.</p>

<p>Martin came in with Peggy’s pinafore, and glanced
at the tea-tray while she put it on. “I’ll just bring
a kitchen cup for Miss Peggy,” she said, adding aside
to Aunt Euphemia, “<span class='it'>She’s an awfu’ breaker!</span>”</p>

<p>Peggy blushed hotly. She knew that she often
broke things, but it was horrid of Martin to remind
Aunt Euphemia of it just then. She had wanted to
take tea out of one of those nice cups with the roses
on them; it wouldn’t taste a bit nice out of a kitchen
cup. But it was of no use to object. Martin always
had her way, so the kitchen cup was brought, and an
ugly kitchen plate also. It was wonderful how good
tea tasted after all, and the strange bread had a nice
salt taste, and the strawberry jam was different too.
Altogether, Peggy enjoyed tea very much.</p>

<p>When it was done, she went across to the sofa to
see what Patrick was doing. He opened his green
eyes, and looked at her sleepily. One of his paws
was lying out on the cushion. Peggy took it up
in her hand and felt the funny little pads of black
skin on his feet. She knew, because she had a cat
at home, that if you give a cat’s paw ever such
a tiny squeeze with your hand, its claws pop out
from between the little pads of black skin. She
had sometimes done it to old Tuffy at home; so she
gave Patrick’s paw the tiniest squeeze possible, just
to see the claws slide out from their sheaths. But
instead of receiving this in Tuffy’s kind way, Patrick
put out his paw in a furious rage at her, and buried
all his claws in her arm. Oh, what a howl Peggy
gave, and what long, red scratches appeared down
her arm! Then Patrick jumped down from his pillow
with an angry fizz, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia rang the bell without a word.</p>

<p>“Martin,” she said, “put Miss Peggy to bed; she
has been teasing Patrick!”</p>

<p>And Peggy, sobbing with pain, went off to bed.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capy.jpg' style='float:left;width:20%;' alt='Y'/>ou</span> will not have read even as
much as this without finding
out that Peggy was always
getting into trouble. And indeed
it was her nature to do
so, poor dear, though it seldom
was through any serious fault
on her part. The first evening
of her visit to Seafield had ended in this fight
with Patrick, and the next morning something much
worse happened. I must tell you all about it.</p>

<p>The sun was shining very brightly next morning,
and Peggy felt as happy as possible. On the way
downstairs she met Patrick; and because she was
very sweet-tempered and forgiving, she sat down on
the top step at once, and held out her hand to him—a
little warily, of course.</p>

<p>She was delighted to see that Patrick, too, wanted
to be on friendly terms. He came and rubbed his
head against her and purred. So they made it up,
and Peggy ran downstairs.</p>

<p>“May I play in the garden, auntie?” she asked
at breakfast.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia considered for a moment. “Yes,
if you do not leave the garden, and do not tread
upon the flower-beds, or gather the flowers,” she
answered at last.</p>

<p>Peggy did not much mind these regulations. It
looked so delightful out there in the sunshine that
she wanted nothing else. So when breakfast was
over, she ran out and began to wander about, looking
at all the new things—quite new most of them were
to her. Different flowers grew here from those that
filled the garden at home, and they were so nice to
smell, even if she might not pick them. In one
corner grew a bush of a great feathery shrub that
she had never seen before. She walked round and
round it, and longed to have one of the long feathery
switches for a wand, such as fairies use.</p>

<p>Just as she was thinking how much she would
like this, a young man came across the lawn with
the mowing-machine. He looked good-natured, Peggy
thought, and she wondered if she might ask him
about the wand. She did not know his name,
however, and felt a little shy. She stood still, with
her finger in her mouth (a bad habit she had), and
watched him while he poured oil into the little holes
of the mowing-machine. Then she summoned up
courage to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Man,” she said, in a very shy voice—“man, I
would like one of these branches for a fairy-wand;
do you think I might have one?” She pointed to
the bush.</p>

<p>He looked up with a grunt and a laugh, flung
down the oil-can, and drew a big clasp-knife out of
his pocket. “One o’ thae yins?” he asked in a
kind voice.</p>

<p>She nodded, and pointed to the branch she specially
desired.</p>

<p>“What’s your name, please?” she asked.</p>

<p>“James, missie,” he said, hacking away at the
branch while he spoke, and in a minute he handed
her the lovely long spray she had wanted.</p>

<p>Oh, what a wand it was!—longer a great deal
than herself, and so supple that it bent just like a
whip.</p>

<p>“See here, missie,” said James; “ye’ll no can
manage it that way; I’ll peel it to ye.” He took
the branch and began peeling off the outer skin till
it showed a satin-like white wood.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me peel!” cried Peggy; and together they
peeled away till the branch was bare—all except a
beautiful bunch like a green tassel at the tip.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:40%'>
<img src='images/003.jpg' alt='fairy wand' id='iid-0006' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>With this in her hand, Peggy walked away across
the lawn, and you may fancy how
delightful it was. She pretended
she was a fairy queen, and a
touch of her wand would do whatever
she chose. She walked about
muttering charms to
the flowers, and then saw
her friend Patrick lying on
a bank. She graciously extended
the tip of her wand to
him, and he played with it for a
minute quite like a kitten.</p>

<p>But then it struck her that she
would walk round the house. And
outside one of the windows she
saw the funniest thing hanging. It
looked like a little bottle made of
flimsy gray paper. She wondered
what it could possibly be; and standing right under
it, she poked up her hand and tickled the mouth of
the gray-paper bottle. The next moment, she heard
a terrible buzzing noise, and a cloud of wasps came
flying down upon her. Peggy never knew what she
did. Down went the wand, and she screamed aloud,
for the wasps were stinging her all over her hands
and face. The next moment James came running up
the bank to her. He caught her up in his arms and
ran across the lawn. They both seemed surrounded
and followed by the wasps, and a new sting came
on poor Peggy’s face or neck every moment. There
was a gate in the garden wall, and James ran to
the gate, opened it, and crossed the road. The next
minute Peggy saw that he was wading into the sea
with her and dipping her under the water.</p>

<p>The wasps fell away in the distance, an angry,
buzzing, black cloud; and poor Peggy, more dead than
alive, found herself being carried back to the house,
all her clothes dripping with the salt water. James
was dripping too, and moving his head in a queer
way as if his neck hurt him.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span><h1>CHAPTER III.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DOCTOR.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt.jpg' style='float:left;width:30%;' alt='T'/>hough</span> it was only
ten o’clock in the
morning, Peggy was
glad enough to be
put to bed at once
when she got back
to the house. Martin
and Aunt Euphemia
rubbed all her stings
with washing-blue
and earth, and after that the worst of the pain
went out of them. But how Peggy’s head did begin
to ache! Then she got sleepy, and had funny dreams,
and woke up crying, and couldn’t eat the nice dinner
Martin brought up to her. Martin was quite kind too,
and tried to get her to eat; but it was no use—she
did not want anything. It was very hot too—oh, so
hot, Peggy couldn’t lie still, and tumbled about in
bed. At last, just when she was so hot that she
sat up to see if that would make her cooler, Aunt
Euphemia came in, bringing with her a strange man,
who laid Peggy down on the pillows again, and took
hold of her wrist with one hand, while he held his
watch in the other.</p>

<p>“This is the doctor, Peggy,” said Aunt Euphemia
in explanation.</p>

<p>“Do the stings hurt you still, Peggy?” he asked,
pulling up her sleeves to look at the marks on her
arm. But Peggy scarcely knew what hurt her most,
her head was so sore, and she felt so sick.</p>

<p>“I am going to make you quite well,” the doctor
said; “but you must take something nasty first.”</p>

<p>He looked at Peggy and laughed.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia looked very stern. “I will make
her take it!” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Peggy is too good to need to be made to take
things, I’m sure,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>Peggy sat up suddenly in bed.</p>

<p>“If <span class='it'>you</span> give it to me <span class='it'>quick</span>,” she said to the doctor,
“I’ll take it!”</p>

<p>“Very well; here it is,” he said, shaking a powder
into a glass, and holding it out to Peggy.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia expected her to taste it and declare
she couldn’t take it; but Peggy drank the medicine
right off without a word, and lay down again.</p>

<p>“Poor little soul! Keep her in bed to-morrow, and
I fancy she will be all right next day,” said the doctor.—“Good-night,
Peggy; go to sleep, and if you are quite
well on Thursday when I come you shall have a ride
on my horse.”</p>

<p>These were the last words Peggy heard, and she fell
asleep very soon, and slept all night long.</p>

<p>It is horrid to be kept in bed when one feels quite
well. Peggy wanted to get up and go out next day,
and instead, had to lie still with nothing to amuse her.
The bed she was in was of a kind you never see nowadays,
with four huge mahogany pillars supporting
red damask curtains. It was just like sleeping in
a tent.</p>

<p>Peggy found that by sitting high up on the pillows
she could see out of the window. The sea was right
in front of the house, and a little harbour filled with
ships. There was a funny noise always going on at
the harbour, and Martin told her it was the ships
being loaded with coal. In the evening, just when
Peggy was very dull, she saw a ship with great white
sails come floating along. There was scarcely any
wind, so every one of the sails was up, and it looked
like a big white bird. Then, as it came near the
mouth of the harbour, it stood quite still in the water,
and a little steamer went puffing out to it. A rope
was thrown to the ship, and by this rope it was
towed into the harbour. Peggy could hear the men
calling out to one another and laughing.</p>

<p>“Maybe, if you are good, Miss Peggy, I’ll take ye
down to the harbour one day,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Might I get on to one of the ships?” Peggy asked.</p>

<p>“No, no—dirty places—all coal-dust; whatever
would Miss Roberts say to that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I would like to be on a ship, and the
coal-dust would do me no harm,” pleaded Peggy.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing but dirty Germans on the ships,
Miss Peggy—speaking like monkeys, and rings in
their ears—Spanish, and Dutch, and Italian, some of
them. No, no; it’s no place for you!”</p>

<p>Peggy said no more. But, would you believe it,
she decided that she <span class='it'>must</span> see these men with rings
in their ears, who spoke like monkeys, however she
managed it. And with this thought she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton came on Thursday, and by that time
Peggy was quite well, and out of bed again.</p>

<p>“May I take her down the avenue on my horse,
Miss Roberts?” he asked of Aunt Euphemia. “I
promised her that I would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t trouble with the child,” said Aunt
Euphemia. “I mean to take her for a drive with
me this afternoon.”</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:50%'>
<img src='images/004.jpg' alt='horse ride' id='iid-0007' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, and Peggy looked
very hard at Dr. Seaton—very hard indeed. A
drive with
Aunt Euphemia
would be
quite different
from a ride
with him, she
thought.</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I
take her? She
shall not get into any mischief,” he said.</p>

<p>Peggy gave his hand a little squeeze to show
what <span class='it'>she</span> felt about it, and Aunt Euphemia consented.</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton’s horse was tied to a ring at the door—a
high, gray beast. It had taken a mouthful of the
earwig roses, and was munching away at them when
Peggy came down the steps.</p>

<p>“O horse, there are such lots of earwigs in these
roses,” she said in disgust, “I am sure they can’t be
nice to eat!”</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton laughed, and told Peggy the horse didn’t
mind the taste of earwigs a bit. Then he lifted her
up on to the shiny saddle that made a nice creaking
noise, and gave her the reins into her own hands,
while he held her on. The horse stepped away
down the avenue so obediently, just as if he were
quite accustomed to having Peggy on his back. It
was delightful, being so high up, and feeling the
horse move. Peggy thought it made up for the
wasps.</p>

<p>“I’m glad the wasps made me ill,” she said, “or I
wouldn’t have had this ride.”</p>

<p>At the gate they came in sight of the sea, and
Peggy remembered what Martin had told her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Martin told me the men on the ships talked
like monkeys and had rings in their ears,” she said,
“and I want to see them.”</p>

<p>“Have you never been on a ship?” Dr. Seaton
asked.</p>

<p>“No, never. The sea doesn’t come near home, you
know,” Peggy explained.</p>

<p>“Well, would you like to come with me some day
on to one? Would Aunt Euphemia let you? I go
to see a boy with a broken arm on one of the ships.
I’ll take you, if your aunt lets you come.”</p>

<p>Peggy was quite sure now that it was worth while
being ill. Dr. Seaton lifted her down off the horse,
and told her to run back up the avenue.</p>

<p>“I’d like just to kiss the horse’s nose first,” she
said. “He has been so nice.”</p>

<p>But Dr. Seaton suggested it would be wiser to pat
him—just in case he were to bite; so Peggy contented
herself with this, and then ran away up the
avenue as pleased as possible.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capm.jpg' style='float:left;width:30%;' alt='M'/>artin</span> will put on
your hat and jacket,
Peggy, and you will
come out for a nice drive
with me at three o’clock,”
said Aunt Euphemia at
lunch. This seemed a
pleasant thing to do,
but Peggy did not
look pleased. She sat
quite still and made
no answer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish to
come?” asked Aunt Euphemia at last.</p>

<p>“No,” said truthful Peggy. The fact was, she had
found such a delightful new game that she wanted to
go on playing it all the rest of her life.</p>

<p>“What would you do if you stayed at home?”
asked Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>Peggy would not say. It spoils a game so much
to explain it to other people.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to stay and play in the garden,” she
said.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia was not at all pleased. She
thought it was because Peggy did not love her that
she refused to go out with her.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said; “of course, I do not wish to
take a little girl with me who does not care for me.”</p>

<p>Peggy felt sorry, but she couldn’t explain; it
would have spoilt everything, you know. She stood
on the steps and watched Aunt Euphemia drive away,
and then she clapped her hands, and danced off into
the garden. A flight of old stone steps led down
from one part of the garden to another; beside the
steps there was a rockery, and Peggy had found
among the stones a lot of lumps of soft white
chalk.</p>

<p>She could make her fingers as white as snow by
gently rubbing the chalk over them, but the nicest
thing to do with it was to pound it down into
a lovely soft powder with another stone. Peggy sat
on the lowest step of the stone stair and pounded the
chalk on the step above her. It was delightful to
do. Among the powder she found here and there
a little white stone. She called them pearls, and
decided to make a collection of them, so that she
might string them into a necklace. It was not every
lump of chalk that had a white stone in it, however,
as she soon found out. But this only made it more
exciting. The time slipped away so fast at this game
that Peggy couldn’t believe that it really was the tea-bell
she heard. “Why, auntie must have come
home,” she thought, “and I must go in for tea now;
but I can come out and hunt for pearls again after
tea.” She gathered up her little white stones in her
hand, and went slowly into the house counting them
over in her palm.</p>

<p>“Peggy!” cried Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>Peggy had walked into the drawing-room, still
counting the treasures.</p>

<p>“Yes, auntie,” she replied. “Oh, do look at my
pearls!”</p>

<p>“I’ll look first at your dress, Peggy. What have
you been doing to it? I never saw a child like you
for getting into mischief. Ring the bell, and come
here and tell me how you have destroyed your
frock.”</p>

<p>Peggy looked down. The front of her blue serge
frock was covered all over with chalk. She seemed
to have rubbed it into the stuff in the strangest way.
She was as white as a miller.</p>

<p>“O auntie, I’m sorry! It’s the chalk,” Peggy
cried.</p>

<p>“What chalk? Where did you get chalk, and how
did you smear it over yourself in this way?” asked
Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>“I was finding pearls—such lovely pearls. I am
going to make a necklace of them; see!” said Peggy,
holding them out to her aunt to be admired.</p>

<p>“Just bits of stone. What nonsense! Throw them
out of the window,” said Aunt Euphemia. She was
much displeased.</p>

<p>Peggy was very obedient. It did not occur to her
to refuse to throw the pearls away. She walked
across to the open window, and flung them out with
scarcely any hesitation; but, oh dear, what it cost her!
Such a sore lump came into her throat, and she kept
swallowing it down so hard. Then Martin came in,
looking very cross, and carrying a large cloth-brush,
and she was taken to the front door and brushed,
and brushed, to get the chalk away.</p>

<p>“You’ll please not to play <span class='it'>that</span> game again,” said
Martin crossly. “It’s a queer thing you can’t be alone
half an hour without getting into mischief.”</p>

<p>Peggy made no answer. Her throat was too sore
with trying not to cry. For nothing else seemed as
if it would give her any pleasure again if she wasn’t
allowed to pound chalk and find pearls.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capn.jpg' style='float:left;width:25%;' alt='N'/>ow I</span> must tell you about something
naughty that Peggy did.
This was how it came about.</p>

<p>All the rest of the evening
Aunt Euphemia and Martin seemed
to think that Peggy was in disgrace,
because she had spoilt her
frock, and perhaps also because she
was a little bit sulky. It is a
horrid thing to sulk. It does
no good; but often one wants
to do it so much. Aunt Euphemia
went and sat out in
the garden after tea, and made
Peggy sit beside her playing
with a doll, and all the time
she was anxious to be pounding chalk instead, so
she didn’t care in the least for her doll. The only
thing she could do was to pretend that she was very
angry with the doll, and beat it severely several times.
But even this did not make the evening pass quickly.
It was a terribly hot day, and that made Peggy feel
cross also. After supper Aunt Euphemia read aloud
what she thought was a nice story to her; but
Peggy didn’t care about it in the least, and at eight
o’clock she was put to bed by Martin, who was still
rather grim.</p>

<p>Peggy’s room was on the ground floor, and had a
great big window. She asked Martin to let her keep
the blind up, so that she might look out and see the
ships if she wasn’t asleep; but Martin said that if
she wasn’t asleep she should be, and drew down the
blind. Peggy fell asleep pretty soon after this; but
it was so hot that she soon woke and sat up in bed.
It must have been only two or three hours since she
went to bed, for it was still a soft dusk outside, as
it often is between ten and eleven o’clock on a mid-summer
night.</p>

<p>“Oh, how hot!” Peggy thought. Then she got up,
and walked across the floor to the window, and lifted
the blind. How cool and sweet the garden was!
She stood and looked out, and wondered if every one
had gone to bed, the house sounded so quiet. Then
a sudden thought struck her. Why shouldn’t she
get out at the window, and go and play at finding
pearls just now? No one would know, and the
chalk wouldn’t leave any mark on her nightgown.
Because it was still light, it never occurred to Peggy
to feel frightened to go out into the garden. She
thought it would be the greatest fun to have her
game in spite of Aunt Euphemia and Martin; so
she wriggled on her little white dressing-gown, and
drawing a chair to the window, climbed up on it, and
threw up the window very softly.</p>

<p>That was quite easy to do; and oh, it was nice
outside! The grass felt so delicious to her bare feet—so
cool and rough. She had to run right across
the lawn to get to the steps, and there were the dear
chalk lumps lying waiting for her, and her pounding-stone!</p>

<p>“I must be <span class='it'>very</span> careful not to make a noise, for
then Martin might look out and see me,” she thought;
and so she squeezed the chalk carefully and quietly,
and searched among it for the precious little white
stones.</p>

<p>What fun it was to be doing this unknown to any
one! And then all of a sudden the game seemed to
lose its pleasure, because Peggy knew quite well she
shouldn’t do it. She would not confess this to herself
for some time, but went on crushing the chalk
and thinking. Then she rose a little uneasily, and
laid down her stone, and stood up.</p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width:50%'>
<img src='images/006.jpg' alt='in the night' id='iid-0009' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“I think I must go back to bed, and say my
prayer, and perhaps I’ll be forgiven,” she said to
herself.</p>

<p>Just as she stood up, she heard the trot of a
horse passing on the road. The wall was very low
which separated the garden from the road, and any
one riding past could see her distinctly as she stood
there. The horse stopped.</p>

<p>“Hullo! is this a little ghost?” said a voice speaking
to her.</p>

<p>Peggy was terribly frightened. She knew it was
Dr. Seaton’s voice. She stood, and made no answer.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Peggy?” he asked; “and why are
you out here so late at night?”</p>

<p>Peggy knew it was impossible to hide. She
answered in a trembling voice, “Yes, it’s me; I’m
playing.”</p>

<p>“Playing? Does your aunt know? What have
you got on?” he asked.</p>

<p>He tied up the horse to a tree, and jumping over
the low garden wall, came to where Peggy stood.</p>

<p>“Child, what are you doing?—bare feet, and
scarcely any clothes on!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <span class='it'>wanted</span> to play at it—at pounding chalk;
and auntie wouldn’t let me in the day-time, and I
came out, and it was so nice at first, and then it
turned horrid; and, oh, I’m frightened, and I want
to go back to bed!” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“You should be scolded for this, Peggy, but it’s
too late for that now. Come, and I’ll lift you in at
your window, and you will soon be asleep again,”
said Dr. Seaton. He stooped down, and lifted Peggy
right up in his arms, and carried her across the lawn
to the window. “And now, suppose I hadn’t happened
to see you, how would you have got in there?”
he asked. “You know, Peggy, getting out of a window
is a different matter from getting in at it again.”</p>

<p>The thought of this appalled Peggy. What indeed
would she have done?</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Oh, they would have found out!</span>” she said in a
terrified whisper.</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean to let them find out, as it is?”
Dr. Seaton asked very gravely. “When you do
what is wrong, the best thing you can do is to tell
about it, Peggy. But it’s too late for lectures. Get
in at the window, and jump into bed, and go to sleep.
Think about your sins in the morning. Good-night,
little one.”</p>

<p>He lifted her through the window, and she landed
safely on the chair. It seemed to Peggy that she
must have been out for hours and hours, and she
crept into bed and drew the blankets round her,
feeling very much ashamed indeed. In the distance
she heard the trot of Dr. Seaton’s horse as it went off
down the road.</p>

<p>Now I wonder whether Peggy would have had the
courage to confess her adventure to Aunt Euphemia.
As it turned out, she was forced to do so; for the
next thing she remembered was Martin standing beside
her saying, “Time to get up, Miss Peggy,” in her
cross voice. Peggy was always glad to jump up; and
this morning, though she felt there was something
disagreeable that she couldn’t remember, she jumped
up as gladly as usual. “Come away to your bath,”
said Martin, who always superintended her toilet.
Peggy loved her bath, and was playing with the soap
and the sponge when Martin came to hurry her.</p>

<p>“Not in your bath yet? I never saw such a child
for putting off time!” she said.</p>

<p>“I was just floating the big sponge for a minute,”
apologized Peggy; but as she spoke, Martin pounced
upon her.</p>

<p>“Mercy me! how ever did you get these feet?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>Peggy looked down. Her little white feet were
all dabbled with earth stains and green streaks.
The lawn had been very wet with dew, and she had
run across it and then across two of the flower-beds,
so the earth had stuck to her damp feet and stained
them brown.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Oh!</span>” said Peggy. She was very frightened. Then
she remembered Dr. Seaton’s advice. “I think,
Martin,” she said, “I will go and speak to auntie
alone.” And without more ado, she ran across the
passage and into Aunt Euphemia’s room without giving
herself time to think. You will find this isn’t a bad
way of telling about anything you are afraid to tell.</p>

<p>“Please, auntie, I’ve come to show you my feet,
and tell. It’s because I went out last night through
the window, after I was put to bed. I wanted to
pound chalk again, and I did for quite a long time,
and then I didn’t, and I went back to bed,” she cried
all in a breath, holding up her night-dress to show
the brown earth-stains on her feet. Aunt Euphemia
sat up in bed and stared.</p>

<p>“Peggy!” she exclaimed, “you went out—went
out into the garden in your night-dress!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Please, auntie don’t be very angry. I didn’t
mean to do anything wrong; it was only that I
wanted so very much to find some more pearls,”
Peggy pleaded.</p>

<p>Martin came in, grim and rather pleased to have
found Peggy out in such a fault.</p>

<p>“There’s no doing with her, Miss Roberts,” she
said—“always in some mischief or other; and if I
may suggest, I think a young lady that could do so
wrong should just be kept in her bed all day. I
doubt but she’ll have got a chill too. A day in bed
will just be the best thing for her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia always agreed with everything
Martin said, and Peggy knew her fate was sealed.
Outside, the beautiful, happy world was all green and
bright; but she was going to be put to bed and kept
there all day.</p>

<p>“Come away,” said Martin triumphantly; “you must
just take your bath, and then go back to your bed,
Miss Peggy. No jam with your bread to-day, mind.”</p>

<p>So Peggy was bathed and put to bed; and turning
her face to the wall, she wept long and bitterly and
repented of her sins.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> makes one feel very sick to cry for a long time.
Peggy cried till she was so tired that she had
to stop because it hurt her to go on. Her face was
swollen up, and her eyes were red, and she looked
quite ugly. But at last she got so tired that she fell
sound asleep, and only wakened up to have dinner.
It was a horrid dinner—cold mutton, rice pudding
without raisins in it, and with no sugar sprinkled
over it; that was all. However, Peggy was wonderfully
hungry, and she ate it up. Then came a very
long hour. She sat up in bed, and looked out at the
ships; she made hills and valleys with the sheets,
piling them up, and smoothing them out; she counted
the roses on the wall-paper; she plaited the fringe of
the counterpane into dozens of little plaits, and yet
the clock in the hall had only struck three. There
was the whole long day to get through!</p>

<p>Then she heard the door-bell ring, and some one
was shown into the drawing-room. She wondered
who it could be.</p>

<p>After ten minutes or so, she heard the drawing-room
door open again, and Aunt Euphemia’s voice
in the hall, saying,—</p>

<p>“No; Peggy is in bed to-day!”</p>

<p>“In bed? I hope the little woman isn’t ill!” some
one said—Dr. Seaton, Peggy thought, with a throb of
delight. Perhaps he would help her.</p>

<p>“No, not ill. I am sorry to say she was a very
naughty child. I am keeping her in bed as a punishment.”</p>

<p>Peggy heard the speakers pause near her door.
Dr. Seaton had evidently stood still as he was going
out.</p>

<p>“Not all day, I hope, Miss Roberts,” he said. “It’s
not good for the child in this hot weather. You
don’t want to have her ill on your hands?”</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia then began to give him the whole
history of the night before; and Dr. Seaton seemed to
listen, as if it were all new to him.</p>

<p>“Well, she told you honestly about it, Miss Roberts.
Don’t you think half a day in bed will be enough
punishment, this time?” he said.</p>

<p>“I wish to be firm!” said Aunt Euphemia; but
there was a sound of wavering in her voice that made
Peggy wriggle in bed with delight, for she thought
her hour of release was coming.</p>

<p>“Suppose you let the child get up now,” Dr. Seaton
urged.</p>

<p>“Oh, she will just get into some fresh mischief the
moment she is out of bed. I never saw a child like
her,” said Aunt Euphemia; “Martin is quite worn out
with looking after her.”</p>

<p>“I saw that pleasant-looking cook of yours gathering
currants in the kitchen-garden as I came past.
Why don’t you let Peggy help her? She couldn’t get
any harm there, I fancy,” said Dr. Seaton. “But I
must go now. Good-bye, Miss Roberts.”</p>

<p>And Peggy heard him run down the steps. Would
she be allowed to get up? She held her breath. Aunt
Euphemia came in.</p>

<p>“Peggy, if you are a very good girl you may get
up now, and go out into the kitchen-garden and
gather black currants with Janet,” she said.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely uttered before Peggy
was out of bed and struggling into her clothes. She
was in such a hurry that she put on her stockings
on the wrong side, and fastened her frock all wrong;
but she managed to get dressed somehow, though
she would have been much quicker if she had not
been in such a hurry—which sounds absurd, but is
quite true. Then out into the sunny garden she ran
as fast as her feet could carry her. It was deliciously
warm, and such a nice, hot, fruity smell was
all over the place. Janet wore a big straw bonnet,
and carried a basket already half full of black currants.</p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width:55%'>
<img src='images/008.jpg' alt='picking currants' id='iid-0011' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>She gave Peggy a very warm welcome, for, unlike
Martin, she was one of those people who love children.</p>

<p>“Dearie me, Miss Peggy! This is fine. Come away
and see which of us will gather quickest,” she said.
“Here’s a wee basket for you, and a wee one for
me; and you take the one side of the bush, and I’ll
have the other, and see who’ll be first!”</p>

<p>She laid down her large basket between them, and
got out the two tiny baskets instead. It is much
nicer to gather fruit in small baskets that are soon
filled, for one seems to be getting on so much quicker.
Peggy worked at a great pace, and actually got her
basket full before Janet, to her great delight. Then
it was poured into the large basket, and she began
again. Thus the work went on for an hour at least.
Peggy was just beginning to think she was getting
a tiny bit tired, when Janet laid down her basket
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Come in-bye, Miss Peggy,” she said. “I hear the
baker’s man at the back door; maybe he’ll have something
for you.”</p>

<p>Peggy followed her to the kitchen, where the
baker’s man had just laid down some loaves on the
table. They were still warm, and the crust had the
nicest smell you can imagine.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking you’d like a piece,” said Janet, taking
up one of the new loaves, and looking at Peggy.
“It wasn’t much o’ a dinner Martin took upstairs
for ye.”</p>

<p>“That was because I was naughty,” Peggy admitted
with a blush.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:35%'>
<img src='images/009.jpg' alt='snack' id='iid-0012' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“Ye’re no naughty now!” said Janet. She took
a knife, and cut a slice of the nice new bread. Then
from the cupboard she took out a round pat
of beautiful fresh butter,
stamped with a swan, and
spread it thickly on the
bread. Last of all, she
sprinkled a lot of sparkling,
brown Jamaica sugar from
the sugar-jar over it,
and handed the bread
to Peggy.</p>

<p>“Oh, <span class='it'>how</span> nice! May I sit
on the doorstep and eat it?” Peggy cried.</p>

<p>I don’t suppose, though she lived to be a hundred
years old, she would ever forget the taste of that
bread and sugar, it was so delicious.</p>

<p>Janet was getting out a huge brass pan from the
scullery, and Peggy wanted to know what it was
meant for.</p>

<p>“It’s to make jam in, Miss Peggy; but that’s too hot
a job for you. Maybe if you go and play for an hour
and come back, I’ll let you stir the pan for a minute
then,” said Janet. And then, anxious that Peggy
should get into no further mischief that night, she
suggested the washing-green as a safe place to spend
the hour in. There were shamrocks growing there,
and clover; and if Peggy could find a four-leaved
clover, she would be lucky all the rest of her life, she
assured her.</p>

<p>The washing-green was very cool and pleasant, and
Peggy lay on her face on the grass and searched for
that four-leaved clover for a whole hour without
being dull for a minute. Then she heard Janet calling
her, and went running to the kitchen. There the
great brass pan was full of boiling fruit, deep crimson,
and with the most delicious smell. Janet gave her
a saucer, and told her that with a large spoon she
might skim the white froth from the edge of the pan.
This was great fun to do; and then she was allowed
to taste it, and it was very good. Then Janet took
the huge pan off the fire, and with a cup began to fill
up rows and rows of jars with the jam. Peggy sat
on the table and counted the jars, and was allowed,
when they were full, to take a damp cloth and wipe
off all the drops of jam from the edges, so that the
jars were all clean and neat. When all this was done
it was quite late, and Janet said Peggy must go and
have her frock changed for the evening now.</p>

<p>“I’ve been <span class='it'>so</span> happy, Janet, I want to stay with
you,” said Peggy, flinging her arms round Janet’s neck
as she said good-night.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ADVENTURE IN THE LANE.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capp.jpg' style='float:left;width:35%;' alt='P'/>eggy</span> had now been for
nearly a week at Seafield,
and it had not
been very satisfactorily
spent.</p>

<p>She arrived on Monday;
that evening she had been
scratched by Patrick. On Tuesday
morning she had been stung by the
wasps, so all Tuesday and Wednesday were spent in
bed. On Thursday she had discovered the game of
chalk-pounding which led her into such trouble that
the half of Friday was spent in bed. Now, on Saturday,
surely things would go better with her. We
shall see if they did.</p>

<p>“Martin is busy this morning,” said Aunt Euphemia,
“so you must play in the garden. Try to play quietly,
and not spoil your frock this time. James is there, so
surely you cannot get into any mischief.”</p>

<p>Peggy assured her aunt that she would be as careful
as possible, and went out into the garden full of
good resolutions. James was very busy sweeping
the avenue. He did not seem to want to talk, so
Peggy left him, and strayed down to the gate. As
she stood and looked through the bars she saw something
so interesting that she at once decided to go out
and see it nearer.</p>

<p>Just outside the gate of Seafield there was a bit
of waste ground close to the seashore. On this bit
of ground some people were camped. There was
a caravan hung all over with baskets, and this
evidently belonged to these people—a man and woman
and three children. As Peggy came up to the gate,
the man was trying to catch the horses and harness
them to the caravan. She watched this with great
interest. Then she saw that there was a donkey also,
so she could not resist the temptation any longer.
Out she went through the gate and spoke to the
woman. “If you please,” she said, “may I pat your
donkey?”</p>

<p>The woman smiled and said, “Oh yes, that you
may, missie,” and called to the children to catch the
donkey and bring it to Peggy to pat. It was a lovely
donkey, pale brown, with a long black cross upon
its back, as all donkeys have. Peggy had been told
the legend about the cross on the donkeys’ backs, so
she stroked the long black mark gravely all the
way down the little beast’s back, remembering about
the story.</p>

<p><a id='front'></a>
“Do you live in that nice place among the baskets?”
she asked the woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, missie, and drive around the country in it
all the day,” said the woman. “Would you like to
come inside and see it?”</p>

<p>Peggy was delighted. She jumped in and saw what
a funny little house it must be to live in.</p>

<p>“We’re just movin’ on, miss,” said the man, coming
to the door to help Peggy out. The horses had been
harnessed now, and the donkey was tied to run
behind the caravan.</p>

<p>“Oh, <span class='it'>please</span>,” said Peggy, “mightn’t I just have the
littlest ride with you? Won’t you take me along the
road?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, missie. ’Twon’t do us no harm,” said
the man good-naturedly. He cracked his whip, and
the caravan swayed as if it would fall over to one
side, and then off they went, rumbling slowly along
the sea-road. The woman gave Peggy a seat, and
chatted away to her in the kindest way.</p>

<p>“This is fun,” said Peggy, and never gave a thought
as to whether she had been wise in doing this. She
told the woman all about herself, and how she had
come to pay her aunt a visit, and how horrid Martin
was, and how nice Janet was. But at last the cart
drew up, and the man came to the door.</p>

<p>“You must be going home, missie,” he said; “I don’t
want to take you too far.” Peggy pleaded just to be
taken to the next corner; so he said he would do that,
but she must get out there.</p>

<p>“There’s a good little lady. Run home straight;
take the first turn on the right, and you’ll be home
in ten minutes,” he said, lifting Peggy down.</p>

<p>“I’m <span class='it'>very</span> sorry. I would like to drive on and on
with you,” said Peggy. And at that the man reached
up to the roof of the caravan, and pulled down
a sweet little green basket, and gave it to Peggy
as a present. Then he cracked his whip again, and
the caravan rumbled off down the road.</p>

<p>Peggy watched till it was out of sight. Then she
began to admire her dear little green basket. “I
must fill it with something,” she thought, and looked
round to see what would be nicest to fill it with.
There was a gate close by leading into a field, and
Peggy saw such lovely large ox-eye daisies growing
there that she at once wished to have them. The
gate was rather stiff to open, but she managed it, and
waded in among the high grass, and pulled and pulled
at the daisies till her basket was overflowing. By
this time she had walked right across the field, and
instead of returning to the gate Peggy stupidly thought
she would go through a gap in the hedge and come
round. So through she went, and came into another
road very like the one she had left. She trotted off
down the road, arranging her daisies, and very happy.
But after a little she found it was not the road she
had come by, and she began to feel a little confused.
She turned and ran back, but couldn’t see the gap in
the hedge. Then Peggy was frightened. There was
no one anywhere near, and she had no idea how to
get home. She ran on, and then ran back, getting
more and more frightened and confused, and at last
she sat down on a heap of stones and began to cry.</p>

<p>Such a feeling of loneliness came over her! She
thought that she must now be miles and miles away
from home, and that she would never see it again.
In reality Peggy was only about one mile from Seafield,
and if she had been sensible, and thought how
to cross the field with the daisies again, she would
probably have found her way back quite easily. But
it is difficult to be sensible when you are frightened;
so instead of thinking, Peggy sat and cried helplessly
by the roadside. It was a very lonely road. No one
passed, and there was not a house in sight anywhere.
She began to feel hungry too, and that made her cry
worse, for she thought she would perhaps never get
any food again, and would die of hunger.</p>

<p>Just then, as Peggy had come to this dismal conclusion,
she saw two figures coming along the road.
One was a woman in a shawl carrying a large basket,
the other was a little girl. Peggy ran towards them
crying,—</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve lost my way; I can’t get home; will you
tell me where to go?” She had been so frightened
that she spoke without looking at the woman, and
when she did look at her, she saw that her face was
not at all a pleasant one. She looked very sly and
nasty, and Peggy shrank back from her, and felt
inclined to run away—only there was no one else
who could help her.</p>

<p>“Where’s your home then?” said the woman, laying
her hand on Peggy’s shoulder and looking hard at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, my home is with my Aunt Euphemia, and her
house is called Seafield, and I can’t find it,” sobbed
Peggy.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll show you the way back, if you give me
something for my trouble,” the woman said.</p>

<p>“I’ve nothing to give you but my little basket,”
said Peggy.</p>

<p>“That pretty dress would please me better, and
them brown shoes,” said the woman. “Just sit down
there and take them off; they’ll be about the size for
my Bessie here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you my shoes,” said poor Peggy; “but
really I can’t give you my frock, for how could I
walk home in my petticoat?”</p>

<p>“Give me the shoes then,” said the woman. So
down sat Peggy on the heap of stones, and tugged off
her brown shoes, and handed them to the woman,
who tucked them into her basket. “And now I’ll
just have them brown stockings too,” she said.</p>

<p>Peggy pulled off her stockings, and stood up on her
little bare white feet. “Now, <span class='it'>please</span>, show me the way
home,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, I must have the frock too. Look at Bessie
all in rags,” said the woman.</p>

<p>She glanced up and down the road to see that no
one was coming, and then hastily began to pull off
Peggy’s frock.</p>

<p>“I’m not giving it to you; you’re stealing it from
me!” cried Peggy indignantly. But the woman said
that unless she gave her the frock she would not
tell her the way
home. So Peggy
had just to allow
herself to be undressed
on the
road.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:50%'>
<img src='images/011.jpg' alt='theif' id='iid-0014' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>The woman
packed the dress
into the basket.
“Now,” she said,
“walk right down
the road till you
come to where
two roads cross,
then go to the right.” Peggy believed her, and ran
away down the road as hard as she could run. In
reality the woman knew no more than Peggy about
the roads, for she was a vagrant who was only passing
through the country. All she wanted was to get
Peggy as far away as possible.</p>

<p>On and on Peggy ran, always looking for the cross
roads that never came. Her poor little feet were
covered with dust, and they began to get very painful,
for she was accustomed to wear shoes always. Then
it felt exceedingly queer to be running along the road
in a petticoat. Peggy didn’t like it at all, but she was
getting so tired that she could think of nothing but
how to get home, and home was really getting farther
and farther away from her at every step she took. At
last, at the corner of the road, Peggy saw a trough
where horses drink, and she was so tired and thirsty
that she sat down on the edge and began to suck up
the water in the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>As she sat there, she heard the sound of wheels
coming along the road, and a little carriage came in
sight, driven by a pretty young lady. Peggy felt
ashamed of her own appearance, sitting there in her
petticoat all covered with dust; but she decided that
she must ask the lady to help her, however queer she
was looking. So she ran forward into the road, and
called out as the carriage came up.</p>

<p>The lady stopped her pony, and the groom jumped
down and held its head.</p>

<p>“Is anything wrong with you, my dear?” the lady
asked. “And how did you get here without your frock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve lost my way; I can’t get home,” cried
Peggy. And indeed her tear-stained face and her
strange garments told their own story.</p>

<p>The lady told Peggy to jump into the carriage, and
then she wrapped her round in a linen dust-rug to
keep her warm.</p>

<p>“If you tell me where you come from I will drive
you home, dear,” she said; and Peggy felt her troubles
were ended at last.</p>

<p>It only took half an hour to reach Seafield after all.
Peggy was almost ashamed to have been so frightened
when she had been so near home, but then she
had not known.</p>

<p>Oh, what a commotion they found Aunt Euphemia
in! She had been searching far and near for Peggy
for two hours, and not a trace of her had been found.
At last Aunt Euphemia had begun to fear that Peggy
had been drowned in the sea; and Martin, who always
took the darkest view of everything, was trying to
make her believe this.</p>

<p>“Miss Peggy’s drowned in the firth by this time,
ma’am,” she was saying with a grim shake of her
head, just as the carriage containing Peggy drew up
at the door.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia ran out to the door, and for the
first time in her life caught Peggy up in her arms
and hugged her, she was so glad to get her alive
and well.</p>

<p>And then there was all the story to tell. Peggy
was too tired with her adventures to be able to tell
the story so that any one could understand it. She
just told a confused tale of baskets and little girls
and a horrid woman; and then, worn out with it all,
she began to cry again most piteously.</p>

<p>Even Aunt Euphemia didn’t scold her, and Martin
brought her a nice dinner, and made her eat it all up,
and then took her upstairs and laid her down to sleep;
and this was the end of Peggy’s adventures for that
day.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SHIP.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capt2.jpg' style='float:left;width:25%;' alt='T'/>he</span> next morning was Sunday,
and Peggy’s heart sank when
her aunt said to her, “I think
I won’t let you out of my
sight to-day, Peggy, for something
always happens whenever
you go even into the
garden alone.”</p>

<p>“It seems to,” Peggy admitted
sadly, but she did not like
the idea of remaining all day long
with Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>Church was long and hot, and then there was
dinner, and then Aunt Euphemia said she would
read Peggy a story. Peggy did not care about
this; she wanted to go out, and yet did not dare
to say so. But just as they were sitting down to
read, Dr. Seaton came in, and Peggy was delighted
to have the reading stopped.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to take Peggy with me to the
harbour, if you will allow it, Miss Roberts,” he said.
“I promised to take her there some day, and I have
more time this afternoon than on week days.”</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia was really rather pleased to get
Peggy off her hands for an hour. She was feeling
sleepy, and it was a bother to her to look after
Peggy, so she consented to Dr. Seaton’s proposal
without any difficulty.</p>

<p>It was not a long walk to the harbour, where
there was much to see.</p>

<p>“I am going to take you on to a Danish ship,”
Dr. Seaton said; “you will hear the men talking
a queer language you have never heard before, and
the captain will take you down into his cabin, I
dare say.”</p>

<p>The Danish ship was lying close up to the quay.
It was painted very bright emerald green, and Dr.
Seaton pointed out to Peggy the figure of a woman
made of wood and painted white which was at the
bow of the ship.</p>

<p>“Poor lady, she goes through all the storms with
her white dress. When she comes into harbour after
a winter storm she is crusted over with salt from
the waves,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why do they have a wooden lady at the end of
the ship?” Peggy asked.</p>

<p>“Because they think it brings luck to the ship,”
said Dr. Seaton.</p>

<p>They came to the side of the quay, and he called
to some of the sailors,
and they came running
forward to lift Peggy on
board.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:50%'>
<img src='images/012.jpg' alt='captain' id='iid-0015' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>Sailors are always
specially clean and tidy
on Sunday, dressed in
their best clothes. They
were such nice-looking
men—tall, with yellow
hair; and Peggy noticed
the rings in their ears at
once. Of course, she couldn’t speak to them, or at
least they couldn’t understand what she said; but
the captain took her hand, and led her all round the
ship, letting her look at everything she wanted to
see—the huge anchor, all red with rust, that took
ever so many men to lift; and what interested Peggy
more than anything—the cargo of tubs that the ship
had brought over. There were tubs of every imaginable
size, down to tiny ones of white wood.</p>

<p>“Oh, I could wash my doll’s clothes in these!”
Peggy cried. She wanted one dreadfully, and yet
didn’t know how to get it, for the man wouldn’t
understand about her doll. As she was standing
there saying, “Doll, doll, doll,” and looking wistfully
at the dear little tubs, Dr. Seaton came round again
from the cabin where he had been seeing a boy
with a broken arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do want a tub to wash my doll’s clothes in
so dreadfully!” Peggy cried, “and he doesn’t understand
what I mean.”</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton said something in German, and in
a minute the captain began to pull out dozens
of tubs for Peggy to choose from. But she was
not quite pleased till she had explained through Dr.
Seaton that she wanted to buy the tub. “I would
never <span class='it'>ask</span> for anything,” she explained—“mother
doesn’t let me do that; and I’ve got a whole shilling
of my own to pay it with.”</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton had to explain this to the captain,
and they both laughed a great deal.</p>

<p>“But you must pay it for me just now please,
Dr. Seaton, because I haven’t my shilling with me,”
Peggy explained; and then a horrid fear overcame
her that perhaps Dr. Seaton did not carry so much
money about with him either, and she would have
to go away without her tub; and he had told her
that the ship would sail next morning!</p>

<p>She began to look very dismal at this thought,
while Dr. Seaton was feeling in his pocket; but to
her great relief he drew out quite a handful of
shillings, and gave one to the captain, who took it
and laughed again.</p>

<p>“There now, Peggy; you can choose which you
like best,” he said.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:40%'>
<img src='images/013.jpg' alt='tub' id='iid-0016' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>It took Peggy a very long time to make up her
mind. At last she chose a beautiful little tub, oval
shaped, bound with three
hoops of white wood, and
with two handles to lift it
by. Dr. Seaton wanted to
hold it for her, but Peggy
wouldn’t let it out of her own hands, she was so
well pleased with it.</p>

<p>The captain told her that the tubs came from
a place in Russia with a funny name—Archangel;
and that pleased Peggy even more, because it was
so much more interesting to have an Archangel tub
than an ordinary Scotch or English one.</p>

<p>Then the captain led the way down into his cabin.
The cabin of a ship like this is not like that of
a large passenger steamer. It is almost as small
and dark as a cupboard, and has only just room
for a tiny table and two or three chairs. The
table was securely fixed to the floor, so that when
the sea was rough with big waves it should not
slide about.</p>

<p>The captain brought out from a cupboard a funny-shaped
bottle, and the smallest glasses Peggy had
ever seen. He poured a little stuff out of the bottle
into the glasses, and offered one to Dr. Seaton, who
took it and smiled; then the captain took one, and
held it out, and knocked the edge of the little glasses
together, making a tinkling sound like a bell.</p>

<p>“What does he do that for?” Peggy asked.</p>

<p>“It’s a way of being friendly and polite in Denmark,”
Dr. Seaton replied.</p>

<p>Then they both smiled and nodded again, and
each drank off the stuff from the glass.</p>

<p>“Let me taste, please,” said Peggy, standing on
tip-toe by the table.</p>

<p>“You would think it horrid,” said Dr. Seaton,
laughing; “it would burn your throat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a <span class='it'>tiny</span> taste—just the tip of my tongue;
I want to so much,” said Peggy.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:40%'>
<img src='images/014.jpg' alt='drink' id='iid-0017' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>So the captain poured another drop into the tiny
glass, and tinkled the edge against his own; and
Peggy, thinking she must imitate Dr. Seaton’s manners,
bowed and smiled and
tried to give the same funny
gulp down of the liquid as he
had done. But there was only
a drop at the bottom of the
glass, and that drop was such
horrid stuff, it was like trying
to swallow mustard, Peggy
thought. She coughed, and
coughed, and coughed till her eyes filled with tears,
and both the men stood laughing at her.</p>

<p>“That will cure you of drinking habits, young
woman,” said Dr. Seaton, “Now we must say good-bye
and come home.”</p>

<p>Peggy was very sorry to leave the ship, for there
seemed to be all manner of queer things to see
there still. But she said good-bye to the captain
very nicely—so nicely that he told her to wait for
a minute; and going to the cupboard, he drew out
from it a huge scarlet shell, which he handed to
Peggy with a bow.</p>

<p>“O Peggy, that is a present you will like!” said
Dr. Seaton.</p>

<p>Peggy could scarcely believe her own good luck.
The shell was so perfectly beautiful; and Dr. Seaton
showed her also that if she held it to her ear she
would hear a rushing noise inside it.</p>

<p>“O captain, thank you <span class='it'>very, very</span> much,” said
Peggy, quite overcome with delight.—“I think you
must carry the tub, Dr. Seaton, for I can’t give my
shell out of my hands,” she said.</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton translated her thanks to the captain,
and he seemed very pleased, and told Peggy he had
a little girl on the other side of the sea just her age.
Peggy stood still looking very uncertain and sad at
this bit of news. Then she pulled at Dr. Seaton’s
hand and whispered something to him. She felt it
was her duty to say so, but it was so difficult that
she could not say it out loud. It was this,—</p>

<p>“Won’t his little daughter want the shell?”</p>

<p>She waited very impatiently to hear what answer
the captain would make; but, to her great relief, he
said that his daughter had lots of shells, because he
took them home to her from almost every voyage.
Then they all shook hands, and Peggy was lifted up
on to the quay again, clasping her large red shell.</p>

<p>“I shall always be able to hear the sea now, even
when I go home far away from it,” she said.</p>

<p>When they reached Seafield, Peggy ran into her
room, and came back with a little netted purse in
her hand. Out of this she took her shilling, and
gave it to Dr. Seaton for the tub. But Dr. Seaton
would not take the shilling, and Peggy was quite
distressed, and turned to Aunt Euphemia to know
what she ought to do. “Please, auntie, I bought
a tub, and now Dr. Seaton won’t take my shilling,”
she said. Aunt Euphemia, too, tried to make him
take it, but all in vain.</p>

<p>So Peggy had to replace the shilling in her purse,
and thank him very much.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE WASHING DAY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><img class='dropcap' src='images/capm2.jpg' style='float:left;width:13%;' alt='M'/>onday</span> morning was hopelessly wet. The
rain came down in sheets, and the garden
looked like a pond. But Peggy was delighted.
“It’s such a good washing day,” she explained
to her aunt, “and all my doll’s things are so black.”</p>

<div class='figright' style='width:30%'>
<img src='images/016.jpg' alt='doll' id='iid-0019' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>Aunt Euphemia suggested that Janet would allow
the washing to go on in the kitchen; and Peggy at
once ran away to fetch the doll’s
clothes and her little tub, and carry
them all to the kitchen. Janet
was very pleased. She put the tub
on a stool, so that it should be just
the right height for Peggy to wash
at, and filled the tub with nice soapy
hot water.</p>

<p>Then she pinned up Peggy’s
sleeves to her shoulders, and together they undressed
the doll (which was a baby one, in long white robes),
and laid its clothes in a heap on a chair.</p>

<p>Peggy would have liked to wash them all at once,
but Janet told her that washerwomen did things one
at a time, so she consented
to do this. The
doll’s long, tucked white
robe was the first to go
into the tub. It was
not indeed very white,
for it had got rather
dirty on the railway
journey.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:40%'>
<img src='images/017.jpg' alt='washing' id='iid-0020' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“Rub it all
over with soap,
Miss Peggy,”
Janet said, and
Peggy rubbed
on the soap as
hard as she
could. How
the water fluffed up! it almost filled the tub, and
Peggy had to part the frothy suds away with her
hand to see to rub the cloth. After the robe had been
well washed, Janet gave Peggy a basin full of clean
water to rinse the soap out of it, and then she took
a ball like a big blue cherry, wrapped it in a bit of
muslin, and shook it about in the water. The water
became bright blue too!</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Peggy, put the robe in,” said Janet.
Peggy was afraid to do it; she thought it would
come out bright blue. But Janet assured her it
would only have a nice bluish look that would make
the white whiter; and Peggy believed her, and dipped
the robe in the blue. It came out as white and nice
as possible.</p>

<p>Then Janet hung it before the kitchen stove to
dry, and Peggy saw that on the stove Janet had put
the dearest little iron to heat.</p>

<p>“Am I to iron it out my own self, Janet?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Miss Peggy, that you are.”</p>

<p>It took only a few minutes for the frock to dry,
and then Janet put a blanket with a sheet over it
upon the lid of a large box, and gave the box to
Peggy for an ironing table.</p>

<p>The little iron was not at all difficult to manage,
and Peggy found that it was delightful to squeeze
all the creases out of her doll’s robe. It looked as
good as new when it was done.</p>

<p>“Why, Janet, Belinda won’t ever need new robes
at all; I can go on washing and washing them,”
Peggy said.</p>

<p>There remained, however, all Belinda’s under-clothes
to be washed; and before they were half
finished, Peggy began to think that washing was
rather hard work.</p>

<p>“My hands feel so queer, Janet,” she said, drawing
them out of the soapy water. They looked indeed
most strange; the skin was all crinkled up in the
funniest way. “Oh, look!” Peggy cried in dismay.</p>

<p>Janet assured her they would come right in a very
short time. “But I’m thinking you’ve washed enough,
Miss Peggy, for one day; maybe I’ll finish it for
you,” she said.</p>

<p>Peggy wasn’t altogether sorry. “Well, Janet, if
you will be so kind as to finish for me, I will go and
listen to my shell,” she said, “and perhaps my hands
will stop feeling funny.”</p>

<p>There was a small library at Seafield where Peggy
was allowed to play by herself. She liked the room
much better than the drawing-room, because there
were such lots of books with nice pictures in them.
Those she liked best were Hume’s “History,” with pictures
of the kings and queens, and Blair’s “Grave,”
with illustrations by a man called William Blake.
Peggy used to spread the large book upon the floor
and pore over the pictures. She didn’t understand
them, but that only made them more interesting.
To-day, instead of looking at the pictures, she got
her red shell, and sat down on the corner of the sofa
holding the shell to her ear. The rushing sound in
the shell was just like the noise of the sea outside,
and Peggy listened to it for a long time. Then
getting a little tired of this, she went to the window
and looked out. The rain had stopped, and the sun
was beginning to come out. The thrushes were
singing as if they liked the rain, and Peggy thought
it would be nice to go out and see what it felt like
also. So she went out to the front door, and stood
there looking out. Then she stepped out on to the
gravel; then she ran a little bit down the avenue;
then she came to the gate and looked out at the sea;
and then a new thought struck her—why should she
not look to see if she could find any lovely red
shells on the beach? The tide was out; there was a
stretch of sand with little pools and rocks covered
with seaweed: surely in these pools or on the sands
she might find a red shell for herself! This was
stupid of Peggy, for shells like that the captain gave
her come from tropic seas, not from our own sea;
but she did not know this.</p>

<p>Out Peggy skipped along the shining sand. It
was firm and nice to run on, and she wondered she
had not done this long ago; it was far nicer than
the garden. Her feet made tracks on the sand like
the footprint Crusoe saw, she thought. Then she came
to a pool with little seaweedy rocks in it. The first
thing she saw there made her stand still with interest:
it was a lot of things like little red flowers
growing on the edge of the rock. But when she put
her hand down and tried to get one, she found it was
alive; and when she touched it, it drew in all its
waving red feelers, and became like a lump of red-currant
jelly fixed to the rock! “I hope I didn’t
hurt it,” Peggy thought. She leant over the pool
and watched it till it cautiously put out first one
feeler and then another, and at last it looked as
pretty as ever again and as much alive. Peggy
wondered what it was called. Then down on the
slushy sand at her feet Peggy saw a great big lump
of jelly, six times as large as the little one in the
pool. It didn’t look very nice, she thought, but she
wondered if, when it was put into the water, it would
bloom out like the other. The only way to find
this out was to lift it into the pool, but Peggy
hesitated about doing this. Then she saw a long
flat stone like a slate lying near, and taking this in
her hand, she tried to slip it under the “jelly beast,”
as she called it. But the jelly beast didn’t seem
to like being disturbed, and it sank down and
down into the soft sand till it almost disappeared.
Peggy became more and more anxious to get it. She
dug her slate down into the sand, and at last, with a
great effort, lifted the jelly beast, along with a great
lump of sand, and flung it into the pool. Then she
sat down to watch it. To her great joy it began,
just like the other one, to put out one feeler after
another, till it lay there at the bottom of the pond
like a big pink rose. “Oh, it’s lovely; I <span class='it'>do</span> want to
have it for my own!” she cried. “I wonder if I
would be allowed to have
it in my tub.” She bent
down to look nearer, and
under the fringe of seaweed
suddenly she saw something
shining red. She plunged
her hand down and grabbed the prize. But, oh dear
me! the next moment she screamed and screamed.
It was a large red crab she had caught at, and the
crab had caught her! Have you seen the crabs lying
in the fish-shop windows twitching their claws? They
look harmless enough, but with these claws they
can hold on in the most terrible way, once they
catch hold of you. Oh, how Peggy screamed! She
ran towards the house splashing through the pools,
with the big red crab hanging on to her hand.
She was in an agony of pain and terror. The
sound of her screams brought James running from
the garden. Peggy ran straight to him, calling out
for help; and James caught up a stone, and gave the
crab such a blow on its claw that it let go in a
moment, and fell to the ground. Peggy’s finger was
bleeding a good deal, and he took out his own
handkerchief and bound it up for her, and then took
her other hand and led her, still sobbing, up to the
house.</p>

<div class='figright' style='width:30%'>
<img src='images/018.jpg' alt='crab' id='iid-0021' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“We’ll gang into Janet, missie,” he said wisely.
He knew that Janet was a more comforting person
than Martin, and Peggy thought so too. Janet took
her on her knee, and kissed her and wiped her eyes,
and looked at the poor nipped finger till gradually
Peggy stopped crying. Then Janet took her to the
pump, and washed her face and hands, and began to
tell her a funny story about a crab that had nipped
her own finger once, till Peggy found herself laughing
instead of crying.</p>

<p>When she was quite happy again, Janet said to
Peggy that they would go together and tell Aunt
Euphemia all about it. Peggy was a little frightened,
but Janet said she must do it, and together they went
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Here it seemed to Peggy that Janet took all the
blame on herself. She told Aunt Euphemia how she
had allowed Peggy to go away from the kitchen, and
had not looked after her, and how Peggy had gone
out alone, and then she told the sad story of the crab.
And Aunt Euphemia, instead of being angry, accepted
the excuses Janet made, for she was very fond of
Janet, and never thought anything she did was wrong.</p>

<p>“Maybe, ma’am, you would let me take Miss Peggy
to the shore myself?” Janet asked; “then she’d get
no mischief.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Janet, I see she must never be left alone
for a minute; so when your work is done, you may
certainly take the child out with you,” said Aunt
Euphemia.</p>

<p>“Come away then, Miss Peggy,” said Janet; “ye’ll
bide wi’ me till I make the currant tart, and in the
afternoon we can gang till the shore.”</p>

<p>Peggy ran off to the kitchen as happy as possible
to make the currant tart, and Janet told her that
they would go down to the shore together, carrying
Peggy’s tub, and fill it with all manner of sea beasts,
and bring them back to the house. And wasn’t
this a delightful suggestion?</p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width:50%'>

<div><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span><h1>CHAPTER X.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SEA BEASTS.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was wonderful how many sea creatures Peggy
and Janet found when they began. The little
tub was quite full before long, and Peggy, looking
into it, told Janet that she was afraid they wouldn’t
be very comfortable.</p>

<p>Janet considered for a minute, and then told Peggy
that there was an old washing-tub in the scullery
which she was sure her aunt would let her use
instead of her own little one; then there would be
room enough for all the creatures to be happy.</p>

<p>“But how would we ever get a washing-tub filled
with water out of the sea?” Peggy asked.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:50%'>
<img src='images/020.jpg' alt='getting a pail' id='iid-0023' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“Hoots! James and me can carry it up in pails,”
said Janet.</p>

<p>“Will <span class='it'>you</span> ask Aunt Euphemia about it?” Peggy
asked. She had begun to see that Janet could get
anything she wanted. Janet said that she would,
and went off to gain Aunt Euphemia’s consent to the
scheme. She
came back smiling,
and Peggy
knew all was
right, so she
clapped her
hands with delight.</p>

<p>“O Janet, do
you think James
will get the water
to-night?” she
cried. “For it
would be horrid if my poor beasts died, or were sick
for want of it.”</p>

<p>Janet then went off to look for James, and before
long Peggy had the joy of seeing him come toiling up
the walk, carrying two huge pails of water. Then
Janet went down to the sea again
with two pails, and brought them
back filled, and James brought two
more, and when they had all been
poured into the tub it was quite full.</p>

<p>“Now I can put in my beasts!” Peggy cried.</p>

<div class='figright' style='width:25%'>
<img src='images/021.jpg' alt='anemone' id='iid-0024' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>The first of all was a great prize: it was a bit of
stone with two sea anemones attached to it. Sea
anemones are the creatures that Peggy had seen in
the pool that were like little pink flowers. Janet
had explained to her that it hurt anemones to be
scraped off the rocks, and so they had to hunt till
they found them growing on a small stone that it
was possible to lift. It had been some time before
they found this, but at last, at the bottom of a pool,
Janet spied a small stone with two beautiful anemones
sticking to it. Whenever she lifted the stone out of
the water, the funny little creatures drew in all their
pretty petal-like feelers, and became like lumps of red-currant
jelly; but the moment Peggy placed them in
the tub of water, out came the feelers one by one till
they were as pretty as ever again.</p>

<p>Then there was one of the big ones that had been
scooped out of the sand with great
difficulty, and was rather offended
evidently, for it took a long time to
put out its feelers—just lay and
sulked on the bottom of the tub. Peggy watched it
for a long time, but as it wouldn’t put out its feelers,
she turned to the other creatures.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:25%'>
<img src='images/022.jpg' alt='shell' id='iid-0025' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>There were a number of whelks. Whelks, you
know, are sea-snails. They live in shells, and draw
themselves in and out of them very quickly. The
moment Peggy put them into the tub, they pushed
their shells on to their backs as snails do, and began
crawling slowly along the edges of the tub.</p>

<p>“O Janet, my whelks will walk out and get lost!”
Peggy cried. But Janet told her she thought they
liked the water best, and would stay in it.</p>

<div class='figright' style='width:25%'>
<img src='images/023.jpg' alt='mussel' id='iid-0026' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>Then there were three mussels. Mussels live in
tight, dark blue shells; but
when they please they can
open their shells, much as
you open a portfolio, for
there is a kind of hinge at the back of the shell.
However, they too were sulky, and lay still quite
tight shut.</p>

<p>Janet had picked up a very large shell, and put it
into the tub, and Peggy asked her why. She said
they would see before long. Now she took the large
shell and laid it in the water. Peggy watched, and
suddenly she saw a thin green leg come stealing out;
then another and another, till at last a tiny green
crab came scrambling altogether out of the shell, and
ran rapidly about the tub.</p>

<p>“O Janet, it’s a little crab! How did you know?
Do they always live in these big snail shells?” Peggy
cried.</p>

<p>Janet told her that they were called hermit crabs,
and that they lived in the cast-off shells of other
creatures, just using them as houses.</p>

<p>“Put your hand into the water, Miss Peggy, and
you will see him run in,” Janet said.</p>

<p>Peggy shook her hand in the water, and saw the
little crab scuttle away and get into his shell like
lightning.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:40%'>
<img src='images/024.jpg' alt='james' id='iid-0027' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>Janet had wanted to add a big red crab, like the
one that nipped Peggy, but Peggy wouldn’t have it.
There were some limpets, in their little pyramid-shaped
shells, and then Janet had added a lot of seaweed
of different kinds. Some of it was slimy green
stuff, like long green hair, which Peggy didn’t at all
admire; but there were pretty feathery pink weed and
nice brown dulse.</p>

<p>“I wonder if James could get a flounder,” Janet
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Peggy asked what a flounder was, and Janet said
it was the kind of flat little fish Peggy had had fried
for breakfast that morning.</p>

<p>“They’re ill to catch,” she added. “But maybe
James could get ye ane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a fish—a real live fish—in my tub would be
so <span class='it'>delicious</span>!” cried Peggy.</p>

<p>She ran off to beg James to try to catch one for
her; and James, who was very obliging, went off once
again to the shore with a pail in search of a flounder.</p>

<p>Peggy stood and watched him for quite half an
hour as he went slowly across
the sands, stooping over each
pool to see if there were flounders
in it.</p>

<p>At last he came back, and
Peggy scarcely liked to ask him
whether he had got one, for she
felt it would be so disappointing
if he hadn’t—her collection
would be quite incomplete. But
James was grinning with pleasure,
and he showed her two nice
brown flounders in the pail.</p>

<p>“Oh, they <span class='it'>are</span> flat!” cried Peggy.</p>

<p>She dived her hands into the pail, and attempted
to catch them—quite in vain. Then James slowly
poured away all the water on to the ground, and
there the flounders lay, flopping about at the bottom
of the pail. Peggy was almost afraid to touch them,
but James said they would do her no harm; so she
caught hold of one of the slippery, wriggling little
fish, and flung it into the tub, and it darted off and
hid itself under the seaweed. Then she put in the
other flounder, and it also hid under the seaweed,
where it couldn’t be seen.</p>

<p>“I think they must be sleepy, and be going to
bed,” Peggy said. And then, quite tired out with
her exertions, she rubbed her eyes and yawned, till
Janet told her it was time for her to go to bed like
the flounders; and Peggy agreed that it was.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LAST DAY AT SEAFIELD.</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>ow,</span> if Peggy had taken time to think about it,
she was only going to make herself unhappy
by collecting all these delightful creatures in the tub;
for her visit to Seafield was to come to an end on
Wednesday, and this was Monday evening. The whole
of Tuesday morning Peggy thought of nothing but her
dear sea beasts. She stood beside the tub and watched
them; she crumbled a bit of bread very fine, and flung
it into the water, and actually saw one of the flounders
eat a crumb; she chased the hermit crab into its shell
a dozen times, and watched the whelks move slowly
along the side of the tub. It was the nicest amusement
she had ever had. But in the afternoon Aunt
Euphemia said that they were going to drive to the
station.</p>

<p>“Your father is coming for you, Peggy, you know;
he is going to take you home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Peggy was very fond of her father—so fond that
she had cried when she said good-bye to him last
week. It surprised Aunt Euphemia extremely that,
instead of being glad to hear of his coming, Peggy
seemed sorry, for she burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Why, Peggy, are you not glad to see your father?”
said Aunt Euphemia.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go home!” Peggy sobbed.</p>

<p>Aunt Euphemia was rather pleased. “Do you want
to stay with me then, dear?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No; it’s my sea beasts. Oh, oh, oh!” sobbed
Peggy. “Do you think father will take the tub of
sea beasts back in the train with us?”</p>

<p>No wonder Aunt Euphemia was hurt. It was nasty
of Peggy to say that she only wanted to stay because
of the sea beasts.</p>

<p>“Of course, he will do nothing of the kind,” said
Aunt Euphemia. “All the beasts must be put back
into the sea to-night.”</p>

<p>She walked away and left Peggy to cry alone. But
after she had cried for some time, Peggy remembered
that father was different from Aunt Euphemia, and
perhaps would not distress her by making her part
from the dear sea beasts. So she dried her eyes, and
thought perhaps it was as well that he was coming.</p>

<p>The drive to the station was quite dull. Nothing
happened, for Peggy wasn’t allowed to sit on the box-seat
with the driver as she wanted to, but had to sit
beside her aunt in the carriage. At the station, too,
there was very little to notice—only some sheep in
a truck, looking very unhappy. Peggy gathered some
blades of grass, and held them to the sheep, and they
nibbled them up. Then the train came puffing in,
and the next minute she saw her father jump out of
a carriage, and come along the platform to where she
was. Peggy was so delighted to see him that she ran
right at him, and caught hold of his knees so that she
nearly made him fall. Then she took his hand, and
began telling him everything at once, in such a hurry
that it was impossible for him to understand anything
she said.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, Peggy. Wait till we are in the carriage,”
he said, laughing.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long time till they were all
packed in, and then Peggy had to climb on to her
father’s knee and put her arm round his neck. “Now
may I begin?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sweetest; tell me all about everything now,”
her father said. And Peggy began her story, of
course, at the wrong end.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a tub full of such dear sea beasts, father,”
she said. “There are two flounders, and a lot of
whelks, and a hermit crab, and two anemones fixed
on a stone, and a big one stuck on to the foot of the
tub, and I watch them all day; and, please, how am
I to take them home?”</p>

<p>“Well, I must come and see them first,” her father
said.</p>

<p>“And please, father, I got lost one day, and had
my frock stolen—the new one—and the bees stung
me, and a crab nipped my finger, and I was very
naughty once—only once—and I went on to a green
ship, and—and—”</p>

<p>“Why, Peggy, you seem to have had a week of the
most extraordinary adventures; it will be quite dull
to come home.”</p>

<p>Peggy wasn’t quite sure about this. She had so
many things she was fond of at home, that if only
she might take her sea beasts back with her, she
thought she would be quite happy to return. She
sat still for a few minutes thinking about this, while
Aunt Euphemia spoke to her father. But the moment
the carriage stopped at the door, she seized her father’s
hand, and begged him to come and see her tub of sea
beasts.</p>

<p>“Not till after tea, Peggy; I’ll come then,” he said.</p>

<p>Peggy would have liked him to come there and
then, but she knew she must wait.</p>

<p>Tea seemed longer than usual. Her father told
her to be quiet, so she ate away without uttering
a word, and listened to all the dull things Aunt
Euphemia was saying. At last, when tea was over,
she came round to where her father
sat, and took hold of his hand,
and gave it a little squeeze,
which she knew he would
understand.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:55%'>
<img src='images/026.jpg' alt='looking in the tub' id='iid-0029' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“Yes,
dearest!”
he said,
but waited
to hear the end of what Aunt Euphemia was saying.
“Now, Peggy,” he said at last, “come along;” and together
they went out to the garden, and came to the
tub. Peggy looked in.</p>

<p>“Why, father,” she cried, “my crab is floating on
his back! Isn’t it funny of him?”</p>

<p>Colonel Roberts examined the crab for a minute.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s dead, Peggy,” he said. “They
don’t turn up their toes that way unless they’re
dead.”</p>

<p>Peggy knelt down, so as to come nearer to the tub,
and looked down into it. Then she uttered a little
wail. “O father, I think they’re <span class='it'>all</span> looking sick
somehow! Look at my flounders!”</p>

<p>One of the flounders, alas! was dead already, as
well as the crab, and the other looked rather sorry
for himself. Colonel Roberts, however, would not let
Peggy cry.</p>

<p>“Look here, child,” he said; “they want to be put
back into the sea—that’s all. There are too many of
them all crowded together in the tub; we’ll take
them back to a pool on the shore, and they will soon
be as frisky as ever again.”</p>

<p>“Not the dead ones,” said Peggy solemnly.</p>

<p>“No, not the poor dead ones, but the sick ones.
Go and fetch me a pail, and we’ll carry them down to
the shore.”</p>

<p>“But then I won’t ever see them again,” Peggy
objected.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t be a selfish little girl. You would
rather they lived and were happy, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ye—s,” Peggy faltered.</p>

<p>“Well, go and fetch the pail.”</p>

<p>After all, it would be good fun to put them all
back into the sea, Peggy thought; so she ran away
and fetched the garden pail from the shed. Colonel
Roberts pulled up his sleeves, and dived his arm into
the tub, and fished up the creatures one by one.
They all looked rather flabby and sick.</p>

<p>“Now, we must take them down to the shore,” he
said.</p>

<p>They selected a nice large pool, and one by one
placed the poor sick creatures into it. Then Peggy
sat down to watch. She had not long to wait: the
sick flounder revived in the most extraordinary
manner, the anemones began to wave their feelers
about in the nice clean water as if they too felt
all right.</p>

<p>“See! they are all quite happy again, Peggy,” said
her father.</p>

<p>“Oh, I <span class='it'>am</span> sorry not to keep them,” said she.
“Do you think I’ll ever get anything to play with
that I can love so much?”</p>

<p>“Well, that depends upon yourself, Peggy; but as
we walk back to the house you can guess what I’ve
got for you at home.”</p>

<p>“Have you got something new for me—something
I’ll love?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite new. I fancy you’ll love it very
much.”</p>

<p>“As much as my sea beasts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a great deal more. What do you think would
be the nicest thing you could have?”</p>

<p>“A Shetland pony?”</p>

<p>“No, far nicer.”</p>

<p>“A big Persian pussy-cat?”</p>

<p>“No, nicer still.”</p>

<p>Peggy began to dance with impatience. “Oh, do
tell me; what is it?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Well, you will find a new sister at home, very
small and pink, with blue eyes and a lot of nice
black hair.”</p>

<p>Peggy received this description dumbly; indeed,
she walked on for a few yards before she said
bitterly,—</p>

<p>“O father, I’d have liked the Shetland pony <span class='it'>ever</span> so
much better; couldn’t you change it yet? Is the
sister much cheaper? I’ll give you my shilling!”</p>

<p>She was rather hurt by the way her father laughed
at this proposal.</p>

<p>“Why, Peggy, a sister will be ever so much nicer
than a pony; she will be able to play with you and
speak to you soon.”</p>

<p>“Can’t she speak? She can’t be a very good
one,” said Peggy dolefully.</p>

<p>“No, she can only cry as yet—she cries a good
deal.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want her then, father. Do please
send her away, and get me the pony instead, or even
the cat.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ve got to keep her, Peggy. Suppose
you wait till you see her. Perhaps you won’t wish
then to send her away.”</p>

<p>“Can she walk, if she is so stupid, and can’t talk?”
Peggy asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh no, she can’t walk; she is dressed in long
robes, just like your Belinda.”</p>

<p>“Who has been playing with her?” Peggy asked.
“Has mother? It doesn’t amuse her much to play
with Belinda, and if this thing is just like her, I
wonder mother cares to play with it either.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother has played with her most of the
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s very queer of her, for she doesn’t
like Belinda a bit,” said Peggy. Then, after a moment’s
silence, she added, “Perhaps I’ll like it too; I don’t
<span class='it'>feel</span> as if I would. And please, father, will you let me
ride up to the house on your back?”</p>

<p>This ended the discussion about the new sister.</p>

<p>And now, if I were to tell you how precious the
new sister was to Peggy, it would take another
volume as big as this to tell it. For when Peggy’s
sister grew a little older, they had such wonderful
adventures together that Peggy used to wonder
how she had got on all the tiresome years when
she was alone.</p>
